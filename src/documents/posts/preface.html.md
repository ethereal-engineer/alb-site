This is a "hello" blog post. A quick one. To test that things are working. Maybe they are. Most likely there's a bug here and there. I'm intending to use the blog section of the site to post the occasional opinion about things. I say occasional and I mean it. I don't even find the time to cook dinner, let alone cook up a witty piece of dribble on a regular basis.  

The site won't only be about apps and iOS development. It's meant to be a place where I can easily refer people to reference articles that I've needed to write to save myself from repeating... myself.  

So fingers crossed that works out. Now I'm off to unwind for the evening.
