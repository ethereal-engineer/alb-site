#### Summary

MDA (short for Medical Doctor's Assistant) was essentially a rapid prototype, albeit one that was expanded to demonstrate several other possible functionalities of the app to hospitals, doctors conventions and existing clients of Emerging Technologies. It was designed as a way to create a paperless hospital environment whilst retaining the paper-trail. Doctors would use it to stay informed and even alerted as to the condition of their respective list of patients, to take notes, to order tests and receive results and many other demo features.

#### Features

- Quick at-a-glance summary of all patients or current patient's status
- Intuitive, clear layout despite an immense number of demonstrable features
- Efficient, uncomplicated input method for measuring routine patient metrics
- Custom internal messaging system between doctors, nurses and staff, following the look and feel of the native Mail app
- A gesture-driven sliding panels interface similar to Twitter's iPad interface

#### Notable Achievements

- Impressed a major Sydney hospital board with my original UI design, subsequently winning a large client contract
- Created a generic Core Data/UITableView framework with a consistent look and feel that simplified the rapid app development
- Condensed several paper-only and physical paradigms into clear and simple UI elements and flows, such as patient information cards, vital statistics charts, assessment sheets and lab reports
