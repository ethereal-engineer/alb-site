#### Summary

Zombie Arcade was my first adventure into the App Store. Although now defunct, it was a huge achievement for me and an even bigger learning experience. The biggest lesson that it taught me was that you can wear many hats, but to do something great, you need to specialise - and to build a great product, you need a team of specialists.

The game offered two modes, both filled with Zombie movie in-jokes and humour. In one, the user could sit back and shoot zombies with a variety of inventive weapons (golf club and balls, records, guns) that they had previously unlocked by achievements. In the other, they could strive to reach the highest level of zombie-endurance, earning trophies, unlocking new weapons and new levels.

As much as I'd love to have it running on the latest hardware for nostalgic reasons, it's outdated code that was naively written with the best of maintenance intentions. To that end, I have made the project open-source and published it on GitHub.

#### Features

- Realistic ragdoll and collision physics
- Blender-created 3D landscapes, models and props
- Easily-expandable rule-based AI with increasing levels of difficulty
- Realistic 3D sound effects and a quality soundtrack
- Interactive 3D apartment menu with light jazz music and an interactive 3D trophy cabinet

#### Notable Achievements

- The 3D apartment menu made use of animated camera paths and dynamic model animations
- Extended the Bullet Physics Engine to add breakable ragdoll physics
- Rewrote SIO2â€™s entire game engine and optimised it to run on older devices (even the very first iPod Touch)
- Built a decoder, player and buffering system from the OGG audio format spec
