I'm really not sure how many main pages to have before it will start to clutter the top bar. It will be a balance of content and design, I guess. Things I want to include on the site are:

- App Recommendations
- Workflow Recommendations for iOS development
- Meditation and mindfulness tips
- Recommended reading for various topics
- Tea tips (maybe)
- A blog with tags (general thoughts, opinions, discussion)
- A tag cloud (or several)
- Sleep tips
- Meditating with Narcolepsy tips
- Handy links for various things
- Coding and industry tips
- Code snippets/GISTs
- Labs (what I'm working on etc)

The site title bar currently flashes to white when changing page. I don't want it to do that!
