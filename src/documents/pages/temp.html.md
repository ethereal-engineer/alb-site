```
title: Temp
layout: page
tags: ['temp','page']
pageOrder: 9
ignored: true
``` 

This is a play space for testing various bootstrap and other site-dev tech.

<div class="alert">
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&times;</button>
  <strong>Warning!</strong> Page content is always subject to change.
</div>

So I can start to type something and give a code example like so:

	a.tipTool();


<div class="well">
Or I can put text into a well like this.
</div>

I can embed GISTS! (and if I want to change my github name, I can make it a var!)
